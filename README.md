# Regression Analysis Using Diabetes Dataset  

This project applies **regression analysis** to a dataset of **Pima Indian ancestry individuals** to predict the **likelihood of developing diabetes**. The primary objectives are:  
- Analyzing diagnostic measurements and their impact on diabetes occurrence  
- Developing a **predictive model** to forecast diabetes probability based on patient data  

##  Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: R  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression Analysis  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression / Logistic Regression  

## Key Achievements  
-  Successfully implemented **regression analysis** to predict **diabetes risk**  
-  Identified **key predictors** influencing the likelihood of diabetes   
-  Developed an **interpretable, data-driven approach** for early diabetes detection
